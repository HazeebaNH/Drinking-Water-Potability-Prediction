# Drinking Water Potability Prediction
This is a project to predict potability of drinking water.

Utilized Pandas for data manipulation and exploration. Employed Seaborn for visual exploration with pairplots and heatmaps.
Implemented a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. Utilized scikit-learn metrics, such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report for model evaluation.
